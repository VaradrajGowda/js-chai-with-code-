//array
// defintion -  The Array object, as with arrays in other programming languages, enables storing a col
// collection of multiple items under a single variable name,


//JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types.

// JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on 

// JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies.

//shallow copies - A shallow copy of an object is a copy whose properties share the same references
// As a result, when you change either the source or the copy, you may also cause the other object to change too


let array =  [ 1,2,3,4]
console.log(array[0])

let heroes =  ["yash" , "ganesh"]
console.log(heroes[1])

// new way to create array 
let arraynew = new Array(1,2,3,4)
console.log(arraynew[2])
